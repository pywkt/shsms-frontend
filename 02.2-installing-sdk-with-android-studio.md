# 08.2 SDK \(with Android Studio\)

If you're running a distro of Linux based on Debian, make sure you have all the required libraries installed on your system.

`sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386`

1. To download Android Studio, navigate to [https://developer.android.com/studio\#downloads](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) and download the version for Linux 
2. Unzip the file to a location you'd prefer, I just keep mine in the Downloads folder because that's how I did it the first time and I just stuck with that for whatever reason. 
3. Once unzipped, in the terminal, navigate to the `bin` folder in the directory you created. For me it's

   `cd ~/Dowloads/android-studio/bin`  

4. Open Android Studio by running  


   `./studio.sh`  

5. Go through the setup and make note of where you install the Android SDK, we will need this path in a minute. I installed my SDK in my home \(~\) directory. So it's `/home/<username>/Android/sdk`.
