# 08.0 SDK Setup Information

So, we're finally ready to get that app going?! Nice. But there are two ways to go about this:

The _"easiest"_ way to get the android sdk on your system is to install Android Studio. Another benefit to this method is that it allows you to run the app in an emulator before deploying to your device.

**Note**: "easiest" is in quotes because, yes, it is pretty simple because installing Android Studio will automatically install the Android SDK and you can keep it up to date by clicking a few buttons, but Android Studio is fairly large and once set up, there's a decent chance you won't be using it regularly unless you really want to play around with the Android-specific parts of the code, which in that case you probably already have it installed.

The other method is to download the Android SDK and then build directly from the terminal. The benefit of this method is that we don't have to fuss with Android Studio being such a pain in the ass all the time. The choice is yours though. I would recommend trying the terminal version first and if that doesn't go as expected switch to the Android Studio method, but hey, I'm a sucker for some sweet terminal time. This is Linux after all...
