# 01. Requirements

**NodeJs/NPM:**  
Type `node -v` in to your terminal. If you see a version number, you're all good. If not, install it by typing `sudo apt install nodejs` and `sudo apt install npm` . After it finishes, type `node -v` again. See a version number? Good. Now do `npm -v`. All set? Great!

**Git**  
Type `git --version` in to the terminal now. Does it give you a version number? No? `sudo apt install git`. Try `git --version` again. Good? Alright, let's go!

There's a one or two more things we'll need, but we'll get them as we go.
