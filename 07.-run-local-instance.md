# 07. Run Local Instance

Make sure you are in the main frontend folder in your terminal \(`shSMS/shsms-frontend`\) and type

1. `npm start` 
2. Once the terminal says _"You can now view shsms in the browser."_, open a browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` and you should see the app running. 
3. Send your Twilio number an SMS from a different number and watch in amazement.

**Protip**: I like to either make the browser window smaller or open dev-tools and set it to the size of a phone so the messages aren't as spread out on the screen. This is intended to be a mobile app after all.

_**Congratulations!**_ You've set up the local web version, but that's probably not why you came here is it? Let's take a breather and get on that Android APK I mentioned earlier...
