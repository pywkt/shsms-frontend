# Final Notes

I originally started this app because when I got to the end of the anonymous cellular devices chapter of the book I realized that the only SMS solution proposed was to have Twilio send me an email and honestly, that just wouldn't work for me. I'm not very active on my phone, but it's unreasonable of me to expect anyone who wants to communicate with me via SMS to download an app like Signal or Wire. So I started messing around and came up with this. 

Although it's not 100% private, with anonymous Twilio, Heroku, mLab, and/or VPS accounts, it works for me. Your personal privacy requirements may differ and that's cool. I've been using it as my main SMS app for a while now. And while there are still some quirks to be worked out and a few things that aren't as seamless as I'd like them to be, I feel that it works rather well for what it's intended to do.

I really hope you get it all up and running and it solves some gap in your day-to-day mobile experience you came here to fill.

Worth mentioning: In the coming weeks I am hoping to have a guide to totally self-host without having to rely on Heroku/Salesforce/mLab. More testing needs to be done though. Just wanted to throw that out there.
