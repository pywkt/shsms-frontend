# 05. Clone the Repo \(backend\)

1. Create a directory on your computer to hold the two repos. When we're all done we will have a folder \(shSMS\) with two folders inside \(shsms-frontend and shsms-backend\). I'm going to make mine in the home directory \(`~`\) of my machine. To be like me, open a terminal and type  


   `cd ~ && mkdir shSMS && cd shSMS && && git clone https://github.com/pywkt/shsms-backend.git`  

2. Go in to the repo folder  


   `cd shsms-backend`  

3. Create an `.env` file that will hold our environmental variables.  


   `touch .env`  


   What's an environmental variable? Glad you asked! It's basically some information that we need to use in our app that is specific to only us and we don't want anyone else to know about it. `.env` files are not published to the internet and should never be made public.  

4. Open the `.env` file you just created and add the following, **be sure to update these with your own information**

**Note**: Files that begin with "." are hidden by default on many machines. You may need to change your folder settings to see them in the folder.

Personally, I prefer to just do it all in the terminal because we're already in there, why bother with all that double-clicking ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ

Using the terminal:

* `nano .env`
* Copy/Paste the sample below
* Change the values to match your own info
* `Ctrl + O` \(save changes\)
* `Enter` \(confirm that you want to overwrite the file\)
* `Ctrl + X` \(exit the Nano text editor\)
* `cat .env` \(print the file to the screen and make sure your changes are correct and saved\)
* `clear` \(clear the terminal in case some shady fools walk past you and want to take all your base\)

Do not use any kind of quotes/spaces/parenthesis around the values after the equal \(=\) sign. Your final `.env` should look something like this

```text
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=IE3c56b36c9832678w32df32f1x99c1arb
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=0re339862f7ef3aq38o2c8ch6km110aa
   MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb+srv://shSMS-admin:dont_hack_me_bro@shsms-cluster.lq31i.mongodb.net/shSMS?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   DEV_SERVER=https://shsms-heroku-server-01.herokuapp.com
   REQ_TOKEN=THIS_IS_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_IT_CAN_BE_ANYTHING
```

`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - Your Twilio SID \(found on the main page of your Twilio console\).

`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - This is directly below the SID, but it's hidden. Just click the 'copy' button and paste it in.

`MONGO_DB_URI` - That MongoDB thing we copied earlier. Make sure to replace the password and database name.

`DEV_SERVER` - The URL of your Heroku instance.

`REQ_TOKEN` - Any "password" unique to you. This is used as validation in **all** requests to your server and will be used in several places and you can change it at any time.

That's all for setting up our backend/server!! Heck yeah. All that's left is cloning that frontend client, adding some `.env` variables to that thing and we're off to the races, at least for a local instance on our computer. Building that APK might be a different story, but we'll get through it together!
