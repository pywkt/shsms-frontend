# 08.1 SDK \(without Android Studio\)

1. Open a new terminal window and Download the Android Command Line Tools zip file for Linux. I'm going to save it in my Downloads folder \(~/Downloads\) At the time of writing this `commandlinetools-linux-7583922_latest.zip` is the latest version. You may need to update the commands to match whatever version you download  


   [https://developer.android.com/studio\#command-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools)  

2. I prefer to keep my SDK in an Android folder in my home folder \(`~/Android`\), but it's up to you where you keep it, just remember where it is because we'll need to reference it in a minute.  


   `cd ~ && mkdir Android && cd Android`  

3. Move the zip in to this folder, unzip the contents, delete the zip file, open the folder 'cmdline-tools', make a folder called 'tools' and move everything in to the newly created 'tools' folder  


   The next command will do everything mentioned above. It looks like a lot, but it's just because I tried to make this as simple as possible by giving you a single one-liner chain of commands. **Don't forget to replace the name of the zip file if yours is different**.  


   `mv ~/Downloads/commandlinetools-linux-7583922_latest.zip ./ && unzip commandlinetools-linux-7583922_latest.zip && rm commandlinetools-linux-7583922_latest.zip && cd cmdline-tools && mkdir tools && mv -i * tools`

  
   That warning at the end kinda scared us, let's just get some re-assurance and make sure everything went as planned  


   `ls tools`  


   You should see the folders `bin` and `lib` and then a few other files in there. Good stuff.  

4. The next step will vary depending on what shell your terminal is using. If you're not sure what that means, you're probably using BASH, but let's double check anyway  


   `echo $SHELL`  


   You will probably see something like `/usr/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/zsh`  

5. If you're using bash, we'll need to edit `.bash_profile`. If you're using zsh you've probably got `.zshrc`  


   `nano ~/.bash_profile`  

6. At the end of the file add the following

   ```text
    export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android
    export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/tools/bin/:$PATH
    export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/:$PATH
    export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/:$PATH
   ```

   See what we did there? We're setting the "home" directory for our Android stuff to `~/Android` and telling it where our command line tools stuff is located.  

7. Save \(`Ctrl + O`, `Enter`\) and exit \(`Ctrl + X`\) 
8. **Close your terminal window and open a new one** 
9. Check to see if sdkmanager installed correctly.  


   `sdkmanager --version`  

10. Install the SDK. At the time of writing this, shSMS is looking for at least 27, so let's do 30 because yolo.  


    `sdkmanager --install "platform-tools" "platforms;android-30" "build-tools;30.0.3" "emulator"`

We good?? I hope so! If you encountered any errors in this process and you're not sure about them, copy/paste it in to whatever search engine you prefer. There's a _really_ good chance that you're not the first person to encounter that issue and someone has figured out a solution.

You might not believe this, but there's only ONE MORE STEP!!! Let's build that damn APK and rejoice!
