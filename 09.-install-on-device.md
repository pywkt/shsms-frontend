# 10. Install on Device

For real, this is the last step!

1. We're going to download the APK we just built directly on to our phone now, but we need to get our local IP address  


   `ip a | grep inet` or `ip a | grep 192.168.`  


   **Note**: if you see a `/24` or `/16` after the local IP address you can ignore it. We just want the `192.168.X.XXX`  

2. In your terminal start a simple python server  


   `python3 -m http.server`  

3. On your GrapheneOS device, open a web browser and go to your local IP address and port 8000  `192.168.X.XXX:8000` 
4. The files in that directory should be listed. 
5. Click the .apk to download it. 
6. Open/install the .apk 
7. Stop the python server by typing `Ctrl + C` 
8. Close the browser and you should now see shSMS as an app installed on your device.

Can you believe it?? You've got some top-notch patience if you made it all the way here, but it's totally worth it! You just added another layer between you and the data-controlling 'man'. These text messages belong to you and you should have the right to choose who sees them. So pat yourself on the back and grab a snack because you deserve it!
